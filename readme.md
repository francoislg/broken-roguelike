## Idea

Make a side-scrolling game where stats are based off weird things that comes from your PC.

For instance, you could have a JumpForce stats that scales off the number of GB in your Downloads folder.

Or attack speed that is based off your internet speed.

## Current Version

The current version works on Windows only, it has a couple of stats, and is more of a PoC than an actual full game.
